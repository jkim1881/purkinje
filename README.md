# purkinje
A computational model of internal timer mechanism in the cerebellar Purkinje cells. This repository contains code to recreate the simulations used in the paper: [Ricci, Kim and Johansson (2018): A Passage-of-time Model of the Cerebellar Purkinje Cell](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03060.pdf).

Code still in the works.
